# General Workflow of analysing a Document
1. Upload Your PDF(s)

Start by uploading one or multiple PDFs directly here. For multi-PDF workflows, name them clearly (e.g., Paper_A.pdf, Paper_B.pdf).

ðŸ§© 2. Use This General-Purpose Prompt Template

After uploading, copy-paste this or use it as a base:

    Persona: You are a scientific research assistant with experience in [insert field].
    Objective: Help me extract and analyze key content from this document.
    Instructions:

        Identify the document structure (e.g., abstract, methods, results).

        Provide a summary of each section and include page numbers.

        Highlight any tables/figures and their page locations.

        Extract any quantitative data, e.g., emissions, costs, yields, etc.

        Note assumptions, uncertainties, or limitations mentioned.

        At the end, generate 3â€“5 tags or keywords describing the document.

    Output format:

        Section summaries with page numbers

        Bullet points of key data or findings

        Tags/keywords

    [Insert optional task here, e.g. "Compare with Paper_B", "Translate to German", etc.]

ðŸ”„ 3. Compare Two PDFs

Here are some prompts can be inserted as optional task:
