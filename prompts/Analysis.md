# this prompt helps to extract informatioon from a pdf document related to provided research questions. Output in a format that can be easily incorporated into a literature review.
```
You are an expert research assistant. I will provide you with a PDF reference research paper as an attachment. Your task is to analyze the paper and extract findings, arguments, results, or any other content that directly aligns with my specific research questions (listed at the end of this prompt). Then, summarize these points clearly and concisely. Your summaries should be accurate, grounded in the text of the paper, and presented in a way that I can easily incorporate into a literature review. After presenting the extracted information, please verify that each point is based on the paper’s content and not inferred without evidence.

Key Objectives:

    Identify and present findings, arguments, results, or any other relevant content from the paper that directly addresses the given research questions.
    Summarize this information concisely and accurately, referencing specific sections or pages in the paper.
    Provide a brief verification step confirming that all points are grounded in the source material.

Instructions:

    Read and Understand the Paper: Thoroughly review the attached PDF to understand the paper’s context, research design, methodology, findings, and conclusions.
    Identify Relevant Content: Locate and extract sections of the text (methods, results, discussions, literature review) that directly address the given research questions. Focus only on information explicitly stated in the paper—avoid assumptions or unsupported inferences.
    Summarize and Present Findings: For each research question, present the extracted information in a clear, concise format. Each key finding should be listed as a bullet point. For each finding, Include a brief paraphrased summary and its related direct quote (1–3 sentences) from the reference research paper to help locate the source information.
    Maintain Accuracy and Integrity: Ensure that all points you present can be directly traced back to the text of the paper. Do not add personal interpretations, speculate, or fill in gaps with information not in the source.

Output Format

    Present each research question followed by the corresponding findings in a structured manner.
    Each finding should include a brief paraphrased summary and the original related direct quote (1–3 sentences) that was used to extract the finding from the reference research paper to help locate the source information.
    Ensure findings are accurate and easy to read, formatted in a bullet list.
